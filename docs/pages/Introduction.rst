Mesoscale ocean eddies are coherent rotating vortices of water with radial scales from 25-250 km and a lifetime of 10 to 100 days [4]. Eddies play a significant role in the mixing and transport of heat, salt, tracers across the global ocean. Moreover, eddies have influence in the atmospheric conditions within their vicinity as well as marine ecosystems. This mesoscale turbulence modifies the response of the global ocean circulation and changes in climate. Thus, understanding global ocean eddy dynamics and their role in influencing the oceanic hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere is on the top of the scientific interest.

Mesoscale eddies constitute one of the principal components of oceanic energy balance. In many parts of the ocean, transient processes contain more kinetic energy (EKE) than the mean kinetic energy (MKE). Hogg *et. al.* showed an intensification of the Southern Ocean eddy field that could lead to changes in overturning circulation, carbon cycling and climate change. However, one difficulty in determining the role of eddies in the oceanic transient adjustment to climate change is the lack of a process-based definition of EKE.
